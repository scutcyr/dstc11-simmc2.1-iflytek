**Allowed Inputs**

* The guideline below shows the input fields that are allowed (default) and disallowed (marked as 'X') at **inference time**, for each subtask.
* Participants are free to use any of the fields below during **training** though as additional supervision signals, and *e.g.* at the inference time use the reconstructed / predicted values instead.

**NOTE**: In general, at inference time for a given turn, participants are not allowed to use any of the ground-truth information from its future turns. For instance, for a coreference resolution task at turn `i`, models shouldn't directly make use of the mentioned object IDs from its direct Assistant response turn at `i` or any information from turn `i+1` and on -- which would essentially be regarded as "peeking into the future" and thus unfair/invalid.

**Notes**

* `transcript_annotated` provides the detailed structural intents, slots and values for each USER turn. `system_transcript_annotated` provides the similar information for ASSISTANT turns.
* `object` field in `transcript_annotated` includes a list of object IDs referred to in each turn - each marked with a local index as defined for each scene.
* You **cannot** use `prefab_path` at inference time for any task apart from response generation.
* For more details, please refer to the full description in the [data README document](https://github.com/facebookresearch/simmc2/tree/master/data).
